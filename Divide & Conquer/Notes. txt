✅ What is Divide & Conquer? (In Simple Words)

Divide & Conquer means:
1️⃣ Divide the problem into smaller parts
2️⃣ Solve each small part
3️⃣ Combine the answers to get the final result

Instead of solving a big problem directly, we:
✅ Break it into smaller problems
✅ Solve them easily
✅ Merge the results

✅ Classic Divide & Conquer Algorithms
| Algorithm             | How it Uses Divide & Conquer  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Binary Search         | Divide array into halves      |
| Merge Sort            | Split → sort → merge          |
| Quick Sort            | Partition → sort left & right |
| Longest Substring ≥ K | Split at invalid characters   |

✅ Example 1 - Longest Substring with At least K Repeating Characters
Key Idea:

Find a character whose frequency < k

That character cannot belong to valid substring

So:

  Split at that character
  Solve left part
  Solve right part
  Take maximum

✅ When Should You Use Divide & Conquer?

Use it when:
✔ Problem can be broken into smaller independent parts
✔ Same logic applies to the smaller parts
✔ Solution of full problem depends on sub-problems

What is Divide & Conquer?
Divide & Conquer is a problem-solving technique where we split a large problem into smaller subproblems, 
solve each one recursively, and combine their results to get the final solution.
